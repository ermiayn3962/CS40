We asked TAs in office hours for help with understanding the assignment and
some issues we encountered. 

We used stack overflow for tracing valgrind issues.

We consulted Hanson's guide to C for documentation of different data structures.

Implemented:
-----------
We believe that we have implemented all elements of the spec to the
specifications, returning EOF when fgetc encounters and error is
something that we are still working on.

We have noticed that on row 8 of the turing-corrupt.pgm file, we are getting a
"invalid read of size 1" error in valgrind. We believe that the error is caused
by a character, but have not been able to properly diagnose the cause of the 
valgrind issue.
