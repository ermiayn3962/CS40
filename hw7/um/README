Routine that takes the most time: 
The routine that takes the most time in our program is technically
malloc/calloc and free, however we do not have any way to optimize calls to
those function, so the next hotspot is our call to Bitpack_newu when we create
the new words while reading in from an um file. This call occurs on line 92 of
um.c.

Can this routine be improved?
No, the assembly for the Bitpack_newu function cannot be improved from where
it currently is. There does not seems to be any glaring ineffeciencies in the
assembly code like extraneous looping or function calls. The function calls
made are necessary to shifting the bits to create the word. Even if it's
argued that you could get rid of the function call to the shifting functions
by pasting their code into Bitwise_newu, the improvement would be so minimal
that it would not be noticeable at all.

Time spent analyzing: 5 hours

Time spent solving after analysis: 20 hours
